# LingJI's Personal Web

This is the source code for my personal website, where I share my professional background, projects, work samples, and digital resume. 

### Tech Stack
The website is developed using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), providing a fast and efficient way to present my portfolio. The design is based on the [Portfolio Minimal Theme](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal) template, offering a organized layout.
