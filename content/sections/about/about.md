I am currently working as a research assistant at Northwestern University in the Xenobot Lab. Our lab is dedicated to creating innovative simulations, robots, and AI systems towards understanding how animals evolve, grow, move, sense, and think. My personal research interests lie in natural language processing , and issues of replicability, generalizability, and interpretability in machine learning models.


Merging my personal interests with that of the lab, Iâ€™m leading this amazing project named Text-to-Robot. The goal of this project is to automatically generate robot designs from text prompts, thereby opening up new possibilities in the crossover between large language models and robotics.


I have studied computer science for about six years, which did award me a good background in the field. I am familiar with a variety of subtopics within computer science,  including but not limited to deep learning, cloud application development, and game development. My portfolio showcases several projects that demonstrate my skills and dedication to advancing technology.
