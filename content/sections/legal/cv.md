### üíº Projects
#### **Text-To-Soft-Toy Web Application**  
**Northwestern University | Sep. ‚Äì Dec. 2023**
- Implemented text input bars and a 3D preview widget using JavaScript and CSS, enabling users to type prompts and select generated toy designs within the user interface.
- Developed an AWS Lambda function to process text prompts and generate 3D printable molds of toy designs in STL format, triggered by PUT events in the S3 bucket for uploading text files. Enabled users to pour silicone into these molds to create physical soft toys from their text prompts.
- Leveraged PySQL for database interactions, supporting key operations such as file upload, download, and user management tasks including account creation, login, and account switching.

#### **Fine-Tuning LLMs for Complex Tasks**  
**Northwestern University | Jan. 2023‚Äì July 2024**
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 with PyTorch and advanced prompt engineering on the MultipleQA datasets, achieving a 43% accuracy rate on multiple-choice questions.
- Applied LoRA to fine-tune Gemini, enabling the model to accurately recover prompts from original and modified texts, achieving a 0.66 similarity score between the recovered and original prompts.
- Utilized QLoRA with 4-bit quantization to fine-tune Gemini 2, enhancing its ability to select the most human-preferred output between competing LLM outputs.

#### **Cross Domain Text Summarization Project**  
**Northwestern University | Mar. ‚Äì July 2023**
- Integrated 6 datasets from diverse domains‚Äîincluding news headlines, scientific abstracts, dialogues, stories, and legal texts‚Äîto create a balanced cross-domain summarization benchmark.
- Collaborated with a team of 5 to apply Sentence-BERT for retrieving the most relevant documents, which enabled incremental fine-tuning of the PEGASUS model and led to improvements in ROUGE scores (R-1/R-2/R-L) from 34/14/24 to 35/17/27, outperforming the original state-of-the-art model.
- Utilized Retrieval-Augmented Generation to generate document embeddings and applied few-shot learning on LLMs to produce more human-preferred summaries.
