      "description": "Our solution leverages the PyTorch Lightning framework for training, utilizing transformer encoder-based architectures. We presented a column-wise ensemble method for post-processing. Other techniques, including rotary positional encoding, data normalization, and log transformation, also helped us achieve a good score.",

The methodology involves incrementally fine-tuning the model using the k most similar documents from a diverse collection of datasets. By leveraging incremental fine-tuning, CRAFT adapts effectively to multiple domains. In testing, it outperformed the baseline PEGASUS on the CNN/DailyMail dataset, demonstrating its capability to generalize across various NLP tasks.",

When a phrase is entered, the system generates a voxel grid representing the toy‚Äôs morphology, which is then used to create a mold for 3D printing. After printing, users can pour silicone into the mold to create a physical soft toy. The backend was implemented using AWS Lambda for processing and S3 for storage, while the frontend includes interactive elements like text input bars and 3D previews.",
